First create an instance of `Calculator`, passing in the values as per the following example:

```kotlin
val calculator = Calculator(
    taxCode = "1250L",        // Required
    wages = 20000.0,          // Required
    payPeriod = YEARLY,       // Required
    pensionAge = false,       // Optional (Default: false)
    hoursPerWeek = null,      // Optional (Default: null)
    taxYear = 2019            // Optional (Default: Current Tax Year)
)
```

> The default values are working in Android (and other JVM) but currently do not seem to be present in iOS, so pass in the default values for now.

Run calculations by calling `run()`:

```kotlin
val response = calculator.run()
```

This will returns an object of type `CalculatorResponse`. This class is broken up into weekly, four_weekly, monthly and yearly. Each of these members is of type `CalculatorResponsePayPeriod` and the members of this class are what will return the values (relative to their PayPeriod) needed for the app, they are:

- `taxToPay: Double`
- `employeesNI: Double`
- `employersNI: Double`
- `wages: Double`
- `taxBreakdown: List<BandBreakdown>`
- `taxFree: Double`
- `totalDeductions: Double`
- `takeHome: Double`

> For tax breakdown this is the amount of tax per tax band which has two members, `percentage: Double` and `amount: Double`.

## Development

## Download

### iOS

Add the framework to the project. All dependencies are bundled!

### Android or JVM
